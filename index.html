    <h1>Everything about blockchains</h1>
    <h2>Peer-to-peer, consensus, smart contracts, evolution</h2>
    <p>Ethereum, to me, it is a mother of the blockchain industry. It is surely not the first blockchain there ever was <em>(Bitcoin and private Bitcoin chains)</em> 
      however, Ethereum is the first one to start a smart contract revolution.</p>
    <p>Rola supportu je najmenej obtiazna pretoze umoznuje prejst cez cele kolo hry bez toho, aby si musel zabijat tzv. mininons, co ma absolutne nebavi a obdivujem ludi ktori nato maju nervy.
      Existuju tri rozne druhy supportov:
      <ul class="supports">
        <li>heavy engage tzv. tank</li>
        <li>mage tzv. mag ktory robi magic damage</li>
        <li>healer ktory vlastne vylepsuje staty najblizsie spolubojovnika</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>What consensus would you chose?</h1>
      <p>A consensus mechanism is a program used in blockchain systems to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger's state. 
        Generally, it is implemented in a network with many processes and users. 
        Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and distributed ledgers benefit from their use because the consensus mechanism replaces much slower human verifiers and auditing.
        For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain uses a mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW), which requires computational power to solve an encrypted puzzle, called the hash. 
        After the hash is solved by one miner (or a group working together), 
        Bitcoin's PoW requires that every node on the network verifies the data that has been changed by checking:
        <ul class="consensus">
          <li>The data structure</li>
          <li>The block header hash</li>
          <li>The block timestamp</li>
          <li>The block size</li>
          <li>The first transaction</li>
        </ul>
